# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React.js Template with:

- Typescript with Strictly Typed Components.
- Day/Night Theme Selection.

- Public and Protected/Authenticated Routes.
- Redux-Toolkit Implemented.
- Api calls with react-query.
- Interceptor for Api responses.
- Development and Production environment setup.
- React MUI for prebuilt UI components.
- Added commonly used modules like date-fns, lodash etc.
